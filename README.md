## Reflections
 - A key challenge of this project was making the most of class instances to create a game that's light and DRY. This was my first attempt at writing code from the ground up alone, and deciding how to utilize the classes of game and player took a lot of thought. I undoubtedly left room for improvement.
 - A big win was applying CSS to create a clean, simple game display that looks and performs that I way I hoped.
